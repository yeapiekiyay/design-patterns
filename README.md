# Design Patterns

## Purpose

This repository will contain a growing number of design patterns as I review them and learn new ones.

## Catalog

Most of the descriptions of the types of design patterns and the design patterns themselves will be paraphrasing or directly quoting sources, which I will try to note to the best of my ability as I go.

### Creational

These types of patterns abstract the instantiation process. They can reduce complexity and decrease coupling by abstracting clients from initialization.

> Class creational patterns use inheritance to vary the class that's instantiated. Object creational patterns delegate instatiation to another object. <sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup>

These patterns:

1. Encapsulate knowledge about which concrete classes a system uses.
1. Hide how instances of the aforementioned classes are created and composed.

## Contributing

See something I implemented correctly or misunderstood? Please feel free to submit a pull request! It's hard to grow and learn without getting feedback and constructive criticism. :)
